## Masked Autoencoders Are Scalable Vision Learners

**Approach**: **MAE** mask random patches of the input image and reconstruct the missing pixels. It is based on two core designs. 

1. Asymmetric **encoder-decoder** architecture:
- **Encoder** is a ViT  but operates only on the visible *unmasked* patches. Encoder embeds patches by a linear projection with added positional embeddings, and then processes the resulting set via a series of Transformer blocks.
- **Decoder** that reconstructs the original image. The input to the MAE decoder is the full set of tokens consisting of (i) *encoded visible patches*, and (ii) *mask tokens*. Add positional embeddings to all tokens in this full set; without this, mask tokens would have no information about their location in the image. The decoder has another series of Transformer blocks.
    - The MAE decoder is only used during pre-training to perform the image reconstruction task (only the encoder is used to produce image representations for recognition). Therefore, the decoder architecture can be flexibly designed in a manner that is independent of the encoder design.
- **Reconstruction target.**
1. Masking a high proportion of the input image, e.g., 75%, yields a nontrivial and
meaningful **self-supervisory** task.

**Introduction**:

> *what makes masked autoencoding different between vision and language*?
> 
1. Convolutions not straightforward to integrate ‘indicators’ such as mask tokens or positional embeddings → ViT
2. Information density is different between language and vision. Masking a very high portion of random patches largely reduces redundancy and creates a challenging self- supervisory task that requires holistic understanding beyond low-level image statistics.
3. In vision, the decoder reconstructs pixels, hence its output is of a lower semantic level than common recognition tasks; different from BERT, where the decoder predicts missing *words* that contain rich semantic information. 

**Related Work**

- **Masked language modeling** and its autoregressive counterparts, *e.g*., BERT [14] and GPT
- **Autoencoding** has an encoder that maps an input to a latent representation and a decoder that reconstructs the input. MAE is a form of denoising autoencoding
- **Masked image encoding** methods learn representations from images corrupted by masking.
- **Self-supervised learning**, contrastive and related methods strongly depend on data augmentation.
