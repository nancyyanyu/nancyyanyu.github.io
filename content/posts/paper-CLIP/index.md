> The simple pre-training task of **predicting which caption goes with which image** is an efficient and scalable way to learn SOTA image representations from scratch. After pre-training, natural language is used to reference learned visual concepts (or describe new ones) enabling **zero-shot transfer** of the model to downstream tasks.

# Learning Transferable Visual Models From Natural Language Supervision

## **Introduction & Motivation:**

- **Zero-shot transfer**: “text-to-text” as a standardized input-output interface has enabled *task-agnostic* architectures to *zero-shot transfer* to downstream datasets removing the need for specialized output heads or dataset specific customization. E.g. GPT3, BERT.
- **Learn image representations from text**: VirTex, ICMLM, and ConVIRT showed the potential of transformer-based language modeling, masked language modeling, and contrastive objectives to learn image representations from text.
- **Scale**: weak supervision have improved performance. But crucial difference between *weakly supervised models* and learning image representations directly from natural language is ***scale***.

**Clip(Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training):** create a new dataset of 400 million (image, text) pairs and a simplified version of *ConVIRT* trained from scratch is an efficient method of **learning from natural language supervision.**

- CLIP outperforms the best publicly available ImageNet model more **computationally efficient**.
- Zero-shot CLIP models more **robust** than equivalent accuracy supervised ImageNet models → zero-shot evaluation of task-agnostic models is much more **representative of a model’s capability**.

**Strengths of learning from natural language:**

1. Easier to scale **natural language supervision** compared to standard crowd-sourced labeling for image classification since it does not require annotations
2. Doesn’t “just” learn a representation but also *connects that representation to language* which enables flexible **zero-shot transfer**.

## **Selecting an Efficient Pre-Training Method - Contrastive learning**

- Given a batch of N (image, text) pairs, CLIP is trained to predict which of the $N\times N$ possible (image, text) pairings across a batch actually occurred.
- CLIP learns a **multi-modal embedding** space by jointly training an image encoder and text encoder to
    - Maximize the **cosine similarity** of the image and text embeddings of the $N$ real pairs in the batch;
    - Minimize the **cosine similarity** of the embeddings of the $N^2 - N$ incorrect pairings.
- Optimize a **symmetric cross entropy loss** over these similarity scores: *multi-class N-pair loss (*InfoNCE loss).

**Choosing and Scaling a Model**

- **Image Encoder:** ResNet-50 & Vision Transformer
- **Text Encoder**: Transformer

## **Training**

- Trained 5 ResNets(ResNet-50, a ResNet-101, and 3 more follow EfficientNet-style model scaling) and 3 Vision Transformers (ViT-B/32, a ViT-B/16, and a ViT-L/14); Adam optimizer
- To accelerate training and save memory, use:
    - Mixed-precision (Micikevicius et al., 2017)
    - Gradient checkpointing (Griewank & Walther, 2000; Chen et al., 2016)
    - Half-precision Adam statistics (Dhariwal et al., 2020)
    - Half-precision stochastically rounded text encoder weights

## **Zero-Shot Transfer**

- **Zero-shot learning**: generalizing to unseen object categories in image classification.
- We motivate studying zero-shot transfer as a way of measuring the *task-learning* capabilities of machine learning systems.
- **Using CLIP for zero-shot transfer:**
    1. Compute the feature embedding of the **image** and the feature embedding of the set of possible **texts** by their respective encoders.
    2. The cosine similarity of these embeddings is then calculated, scaled by a temperature parameter, and normalized via a softmax. 
    - For zero-shot evaluation, we cache the zero-shot classifier once it has been computed by the text encoder and reuse it for all subsequent predictions.
- **Prompt engineering and ensembling**
    - **Issues** of using one-word labels:
        1. **Polysemy** (多义性); 
        2. **Distribution gap**: rare in our pre-training dataset for the text paired with the image to be just a single word. Usually the text is a full sentence describing the image in some way. 
    - **Solution**: **prompt template** “A photo of a flabelg.”is a good default that helps specify the text is about the content of the image.
        - Improve zero-shot performance by customizing the prompt text to each task.
    - **Better solution**: **Ensembling** over multiple zeroshot classifiers using different context prompt.多用几个模版然后把结果结合
